# Calorie_Calculator_app
"Health is wealth” Obviously, you have heard it a thousand times but as we grow older we often
 realize it’s true and this app provides an interesting way to get started with the very boring
 term “dieting” as we already know “FITNESS START WITH WHAT WE EAT"

I developed a Calorie Calculator to record and estimate number of calories we need to consume daily. 
This  project is developed using a python Django framework. 

The following images represent the  output of my project, demonstrating the successful execution of its functionalities.
